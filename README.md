#Covid Response Bot.

This is a fully customizable example Discord bot that you can add to your
Discord guild in just a few clicks. You don't need anything other than a Discord
account to get started! After forking and setting up this app, your bot will:

1. Confirm installation with a message to your **#any channel** channel.
1. Respond when it is tagged in a channel with a friendly, informational message.
1. Replies to messages containing the words **covid**, **cough**, **fever**, or **cold**
with a sample message.
